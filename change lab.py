CHANGE RETURN

LAB: CHANGE RETURN
DELIVERY METHOD: DOCTESTS
GOAL
Write a python script that figures out how to divvy up an amount of change into the fewest quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

INSTRUCTIONS
Some supermarkets have automatic change dispensers.

Ask for the amount of change to dispense in cents.
Assume that the amount input will be less than 100 cents.
Calculate the number of quarters necessary first.
Then calculate the number of dimes, nickels, and pennies.
If you do it in that order, you will minimize the number of coins.
This is easiest done by updating a running total of number of cents left to be put into coins.

Also remember that the // operator divides and removes any remainder.

DOCUMENTATION
PYTHON OFFICIAL DOCS: OPERATORS
ADVANCED
Expand this problem to work on an amount of cents greater than 100 and include bills.
Print out the total number of coins and bills dispensed.
SUPER ADVANCED
Store how many of each coin is in the cash register, then allow the change algorithm to deal with when you donâ€™t have enough coins to optimally give change.
