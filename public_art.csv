With a background in figurative painting, he pursued the exploration of mood, thought, and feeling through abstract works. His abstract paintings were generally based on nature, poetry, scenery, and his never ending curiosity.  Among his many accomplishments, he and his wife, Hilda Morris, received the prestigious Governor's Art Award in Oregon in 1985.

Abstract Expressionism often describes a general attitude rather than a set of concrete facts and artists working in this style generally place great value on spontaneous improvisation and individuality.  Their work may appear to have been created by accident or chance, but it is always thoughtful and can even be highly planned.","http://data.racc.org/pa_inventory/0286/0286thumb.jpg","http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=470.135","2010-02-18 00:00:00"

The mural is a culmination of nearly twenty years of historical research and constitutes a powerful tribute to the generations of courageous people who rose from slavery, endured the hardships of the westward journey, and contributed importantly to the settling of the West. The word ""Bilalian,"" used in the title, is synonymous for ""African American"" and has connotations of courage and strong faith associated with Bilal, the first minister of Islam. The word Odyssey, derived from Homer's poem, suggests virtue and perseverance on an epic scale.

As an African American youth growing up in Portland in the '50s and as an art student at Portland State University in the early '60s, Isaka Shamsud-Din had been frustrated by the lack of information available to him about his cultural heritage. Following his experiences in 1965 as a civil rights activist in Stuttgart, Arkansas, he determined to redress the situation by devoting his life and his art to the preservation and promotion of African American culture.

It has long been considered a seminal piece in the City of Portland's public art collection, and in 2010 was saved from potential deaccession by a careful restoration addressing problems with its structural stability. 

Lee Kelly is a prolific sculptor whose influential work can be found throughout Portland and the Pacific Northwest. Born in Idaho, he attended the Portland Art Museum School in the fifties and has worked and taught in the Portland region for decades. Kelly describes his sculptural process as putting the energy of Abstract Expression into three dimensional form. 

Kelly's wife, Bonnie Bronson, was a well-known Northwest artist before her tragic death in a climbing accident in 1990. She was known for her geometric two dimensional steel and enameled collages she referred to as ""modulars."" The beautiful red-orange tiles in this piece provide an excellent example of her mastery of enamel created through an industrial process that she herself developed in 1973.","http://data.racc.org:8080/pa_inventory/0650/0650thumb.jpg","http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=787.206","2016-01-26 00:00:00"

Gillman designed the sculpture to create a space where people could sit and have quiet time. In his work, he uses the nature of the stone to create a feeling of space and time, juxtaposing natural, manmade, and architectural elements to remind of us of man's place in nature. The following poem was chosen by Gillman to be displayed alongside the finished work.     

Let us be ""Called...by the hopes of children 
to a world of endless wheat and barley sugar...
whatever--the skies now lifted
and the poppies bloomed
and the men and women fed the children 
and the long long lives of elders
kept the history green.""

The totem was carved during Oregon's Centennial in 1959, to celebrate the state's role in Operation Deep Freeze, which established a scientific station at the geographic South Pole.

Born Cherokee, Lelooska (1933-1996) was adopted into the Kwakwaka'wakw, and was known for his mastery of storytelling and carving. As a scholar and educator, Lelooska was an authority on the Indians of North America with a particular emphasis on the tribes of the Northwest coastal region.

Scott's unique, direct, and often dogmatic writing style was greatly influential in regional politics. He shaped the Oregonian's conservative perspective on such issues as women's suffrage, the labor movement, and publicly funded schools. His skill as a journalist and editor brought the Oregonian national recognition. Scott was also an intense enthusiast of the Pacific Northwest, proclaiming the ""greatness"" of the region during his national travels.

""Harvey W. Scott"" was sculpted in 1930 during the same period that Gutzon Borglum was working on Mt. Rushmore.

The sculpture was commissioned after Roosevelt's death as a memorial to what he had come to symbolize to an America that was emerging from its wild past as a world power. At the outbreak of the Spanish American War in 1898, Roosevelt recruited men, many of whom were former college athletes and Western cowboys, to join a cavalry regiment. They were called The Rough Riders. They fought against the Spanish in Cuba, winning fame for their charge up San Juan Hill. 

Proctor is a celebrated American sculptor known for his sculptures of cowboys and animals of the American West, subject matter that during his lifetime was romanticized in Europe and in high-demand. Proctor grew up in Colorado and was as passionate about hunting as he was about art. Like Dr. Henry Waldo Coe, he also was a hunting partner of Roosevelt's. Proctor took great care in accurately depicting Roosevelt as a symbol of American determination, success, and strength and as a bridge back to the Wild West. The sculpture was cast in Brooklyn NY, and, apropos to the part Roosevelt had in the acquirement and development of the Panama Canal, the sculpture was shipped on this route by sea rather than by land to avoid cutting the sculpture into sections to come by rail. Vice President Calvin Coolidge was present at the sculpture's groundbreaking.","http://data.racc.org:8080/pa_inventory/0659/0659thumb.jpg","http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=1192.188","2015-12-11 00:00:00"

In creating pieces for the Midland Library, I designed cast stone medallions for the north and south walls of the buildings exterior.   I wished to link the library to the small park next to it.  I wanted the work to be bold shapes that could be viewed as one walked by, but also could be understood from a distance.

I began thinking of different shapes; an x, a spiral, a diagonal ellipse.  At the same time, I was gathering leaves.  I started making many small models in clay.  Eventually I chose to sculpt native northwest leaves: rhododendron, fern, dogwood, maple and alder.  After I selected these five forms I created more specific models.  At the time, I was learning to paint egg tempera, so I made studies using this technique.

A wooden box ""frame"" was constructed; this would be the size and shape of the final piece and would house the modeled clay leaf.  As a piece was shaped, I would periodically move it outdoors and orient it toward the South, so I could get a sense of shadow at different times of the day. 

From the wood and clay model, a rubber mold was mad.  These were then transported out to the casting company, where they were filled with a cast stone mix which had been specified by the architect.

Two stone chairs/thrones provide a solid and solitary site to feel secure in this moment in this place, to arrive in triumph and to depart from.  When sitting in these larger than lifesize chairs, almost no one ever feels their feet touch the ground, giving the sensation that the potential for growth always exists.  A third sculpture functions as a table/altar/stair element, with the idea that although we can't always see where the next step is, and that the way isn't always smooth or clear, there is a way to the top.  The hand-carved spiral on the surface is a symbol of infinite inner and outer expansion.  The symbol can be looked at from many viewpoints by all ages and can provide a beginning reference point for discussion of where on the path of life one is going and where one has come from.

The fourth stone element, placed separately from the sanctuary, symbolizes passage and is carved in a pod/boat form.  The surface carving of two pooled areas symbolize here to there, with the three separate pathways symbolizing the various ways of getting from here to there.  Much like the stream which runs through the campus, we don't know where it really comes from or quite where or how it gets to the Columbia, but the passage through our lives is the important aspect of its journey.  The campus is the point of passage for the youth who pass through, hopefully finding a way to their best personal destinations. 

The artist was selected through an open competition.  A prospectus was sent to artists in Oregon and Washington.  The project was completed and dedicated in September 1999 as part of a celebration of the entire Children's Campus.","http://data.racc.org:8080/pa_inventory/1256/1256thumb.jpg","http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=1668.189","2016-01-20 00:00:00"

I made a progression using local basalt stone and the existing wrecked concrete.

At the top of the berm there is a grouping of saw-cut vertical basalt, and some irregular, displaced foundations.  As the basalt pieces progress from berm to river, they tip over, so that the concrete below becomes exposed and the basalt becomes submerged and eventually disappears.

At the river path there are various configurations of concrete and stone, including inlays and pieces that can function as seating.  Concrete is cut in various places to expose the river rock aggregate inside as well as the old embedded wood piers, and some heavy steel reinforcement emerges in various plant-like and root-like ways.

The work is meant to be a quiet narrative that is derived and retained from the site, rather than a thing that was brought in.","http://data.racc.org:8080/pa_inventory/1259/1259thumb.jpg","http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=1670.179","2016-02-19 00:00:00"

When we slow down, they no longer make sense; their ability to communicate is dependent upon our quick glance.  These collages are all made from cut and reassembled signs.  They seem recognizable at first, yet lose all information upon viewing.  I am interested in the new communication that is formed in their familiar but unreadable symbols.

The seal depicts a wilderness scene including mountains, forest, and the sea with Lady Commerce in the foreground holding a trident in her right hand. Together, these figures symbolize the origins of the city, its culture, agrarian base, and industry.

Michael Graves, the architect for the Portland Building, suggested a statue of Lady Commerce as part of his design for the building.  Raymond J. Kaskey, a Washington, D.C. sculptor, won the commission through the City's Percent for Art program.  The sculpture is made of hammered copper sheeting about the thickness of a dime formed around a steel armature, and took three years to complete. She is 1/3 the size of the Statue of Liberty, the only larger statue of this kind in the nation. 
 
Portlandia was shipped across the country by rail in eight pieces. After being assembled in a local shipyard, she rode by river barge and truck to her final destination, welcomed by thousands of Portland residents along the riverbank, streets, and bridges.  Her dedication to the citizens of Portland on October 8, 1985, confirmed her acceptance as a new symbol of the city.

As a kid I would go for walks with my father and he would point things out to me. He seemed interested in everything?""an architectural detail, an old tree, a geological formation, a historical monument, an unusual shop or restaurant. Features otherwise hidden to me would be revealed and made significant while spending time with him.

Over the past eight years I have worked on projects exploring the dynamics of social spaces, communities, and environments. These projects have taken the form of installations, publications, educational activities, and public art pieces and have involved a variety of populations: middle school students in Oakland, office workers from the City of Richmond, local residents from the Sunset District in San Francisco, students living in dorms at the University of Washington, shoppers at a mall in Pleasanton, urban gardeners in the Mission District of San Francisco, among others.

My project for the Streetcar Alignment brings together my early memories of walks with my father, photography, and my involvement with community based art projects. To do this I will install a series of solar powered lights on motion sensors to literally highlight aspects of the neighborhoods that the streetcar will be running through. The units would be attached to pre-existing street car poles and operate from dusk to late evening. It's evident that these neighborhoods already have cultural and aesthetic qualities that define them.  

The idea draws strictly on what the various neighborhoods along the alignment already have?""unusual architecture, old signs, specific trees, old fire hydrants and infrastructure, etc. I will choose several locations to just light a circular spot on the sidewalk that a person could walk into and for a moment stand out for their own visual or gestural significance. In a way, the lights would act as real time photographs of interesting aspects in Portland's nighttime urban environment.","http://data.racc.org:8080/pa_inventory/1498/1498thumb.jpg","http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=2183.149","2013-09-23 00:00:00"

Some of the individual details are carved to suggest that artifacts are embedded within the granite base blocks and plinths. Drawn from extensive research, the content of the detail carvings symbolize one or more of the following subjects: a people of common cultural identity, a place in time, historic uses of nearby structures. For example, the southern sculpture on the 3rd and Davis plinth recalls artifacts from Japantown which stood on that location until the ""relocation"" of Japanese-Americans in 1942, while the north sculpture on 3rd and Flanders pays homage to the building of Portland's rail systems, historic and contemporary.

As I considered ways in which humans mark pathways, I thought of cairns, those man-made stacks of stones that mark hiking trails and which historically have served as landmarks for land and sea navigation, memorials, and commemorative markers. Travelers on cross-country trails traditionally add stones to cairns as they pass, resulting in animated and precarious stacks of rocks and pebbles. This evidence of human comings and goings, these reminders that others have followed the same path signify safety and reassurance out in the wilderness. In the urban wilderness, finding one's way through the various stages of hurry-up-and-wait are just as significant. These stand-alone works speak to the step-by-step marking of time, and incorporate varying degrees of elegance and playfulness. They are related to each other through this thematic underpinning and through the use of stone, but each responds to its site in its own way.

On certain nights a great white celestial stag is spied in the skies over Portland.

As the environment has evolved and useful plants such as lodge grass have disappeared, the thistle and other noxious weeds have replaced them, in the same way that wilderness areas have been replaced by suburban developments.

In this sculpture the artist has substituted symbols and imagery for the figure's head and shoulders. One form is an abstract shape suggesting a teepee reflected in water. The other more dominant form is that of a thistle, the first plant to pop back up after you've cleared the land.

The act of combining these forms in new, perhaps unexpected, ways presented interesting problems to Gander as an object maker. He equates the act of solving these problems to basic human tendencies: searching for meaning, significance and understanding.

The designated location for the work was unusual in that it encompassed the outdoor spaces of the Hotel Modera as well as the adjoining sidewalk. For the artist, the material and the site presented both opportunities and challenges. In particular, he wanted to create relationships between the multiple pieces while allowing each piece to stand on its own.

For the concept, Kosuge began by studying the stones, which were relatively small and with curved edges. Their size and shape were central in determining what the final work would look like.

The resulting five sculptures involve interconnecting visual elements that include repetition, tension and stability. Hopefully, each viewer will have a unique opportunity to enjoy the pieces from different perspectives and to understand the relationship of the sculptural shapes to one another.

A professor there told me that one problem humans have in addressing environmental problems is our limited ability to perceive at different scales. Many important things are simply too small or too large for us to comprehend. This made me think it would be valuable to reveal some hidden phenomenon, in particular the beautiful single-celled organisms used to evaluate water quality in urban streams.

Twelve oversized diatoms carved in granite are sited in the biofiltration strips unique to the the southern portion of the transit mall. Placing them in the water filtration strips adds a supporting layer of content to the landscape.Unbeknownst to me, the project was recently shown as part of a presentation at the North American Diatom Symposium, delighting the audience of scientists.

With Urban Hydrology, I tried to thread the needle between beauty, abstraction and content to appeal to both academic and casual viewers.

The mural is located on the bottom half of the east facing wall of the Keller Auditorium along SW 2nd Street between SW Clay and SW Columbia. The design is influenced and inspired by such works as Degas' ballerinas, Cassatt's At the Opera, and Dufy's The Yellow Violin. Also included are a modern dancer, two musicians in an orchestra, and a jazz musician along with an acrobat to represent the large scope of the theater.

According to Kim, the mural serves three main goals: (1) as a Korean-American female artist, she wishes to be a role model to all students including those with different backgrounds; (2) the mural is a teaching tool on the creative process of designing and painting murals in the public sector while collaborating with other artists; (3) providing a gift to the public.

""Star Catcher"", completed in 2015, depicts a person sitting in a desolate (but brightly colored) landscape who is catching stars with a net. These start then light the lantern he is holding as well as the fire that is warming him. There's a magical window on his back and a pearl for his face. The seated character has appeared in other paintings. He finds his inspiration through literature and the classic poetry of Eastern countries. He has said that every time he finishes a work, it is his favorite. You can murals by Qbic in Istanbul; Moscow; and Gdansk, Poland.","http://data.racc.org:8080/pa_inventory/murals/M0073/M0073thumb.jpg","http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=3424.10","2016-01-11 00:00:00"

As he painted this particular mural, he witnessed hundreds of pigeons flying in the area. So he decided to incorporate the pigeon into the mural as a symbol where the Japanese and American cultures can converge. You can see other works by him at Hellion Gallery which is located across the street from the mural, on the second floor (by appointment only).","http://data.racc.org:8080/pa_inventory/murals/M0074/M0074thumb.jpg","http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=3425.11","2016-01-11 00:00:00"

Jaque is an acclaimed multi-media artist from Mexico and Cunningham grew up in Lake Oswego. Both artists travel extensively, creating murals in various venues around the country.

In this mural, modern day digitizations of traditional Native patternwork are combined with logos of industries that have impacted Native communities. The central yellow section of the mural features symbols that serve as a key to interpreting the entire mural and are meant to be both positive and humorous. The wagon on fire references the Oregon Trail from the native perspective. The Wifi and Bluetooth symbols reference the new digital age and it's positive connectivity potential (if it was available for free). The boxing glove symbolizes fighting back against exploitative systems. The circle with four slices signifies the world as well as a target and the idea of taking aim at the oppressors. While the teepee can be viewed as a stereotype, here it is used to symbolize strength. The eagle pattern to the right of it has been used by  quite countless clothing industries around the world. The 100 symbol is meant to reference youth and positivity. The two lines above the boxing glove symbolize peace. The cropped kite symbolizes youth. The clouds at the far left of the yellow section are Fragua's personal symbol.","http://data.racc.org:8080/pa_inventory/murals/M0079/M0079thumb.jpg","http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=3430.23","2016-03-28 00:00:00"

Since July 2014, Open Middle and Hollywood Theatre have collaborated on a school-wide media arts integration initiative funded by the Oregon Community Foundation. Open Middle is a non-profit, educational organization serving youth ages 11-15 who have not fared well in the public school system. The partnership with INSA integrated a multimedia project into Open Middle's art curriculum through a 4-week residency beginning in September 2015.

INSA's unique practice of creating animated murals is called GIF-ITI. GIF-ITI is created by photographing individual layers of a multi-stage, hand-painted mural. These photos are then made into a looping image or GIF. The subject of this GIF-ITI mural was decided upon in collaboration with Open Middle students. The animated format lends itself well to themes like the passage of time or the many moving parts which comprise a system, providing a built-in architecture of participation from which to start. The animated frames were painted using a combination of household and spray paint and photographed at each step. When the mural GIF was complete, the final layer was left remaining for the public to experience. The GIF is shared online and through INSA's app, GIF-ITI VIEWER, available for free in the iTunes store.","http://data.racc.org:8080/pa_inventory/murals/M0080/M0080thumb.jpg","http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=3439.29","2015-11-24 00:00:00"
